# Vacation Tracker API - Setup Guide

Welcome to the Vacation Tracker API project! Follow the steps below to set up and run the project on your local machine.

## Prerequisites

    Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

    - [Java Development Kit (JDK) 11](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html) or higher
    - [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/install.html)
    - [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
    - [Postman](https://www.postman.com/downloads/) (optional, for testing the API)

## Step-by-Step Guide

### 1. Clone the Repository

    First, clone the repository

    git clone <URL>

### 3. Build the Project

    Use Maven to build the project:

    mvn clean install

### 4. Run the Application

    Run the Spring Boot application using Maven:

    mvn spring-boot:run

    Alternatively, you can run the application by executing the generated JAR file:

    java -jar target/vacations-api-1-zpwlqj-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar

### 5. Access the API

    Once the application is running, you can access the API at `http://localhost:8080`.

### 6. Test the API

You can use Postman or any other API testing tool to test the endpoints.
I have attached a Postman Collection in the project for reference.
Below are some example requests:
